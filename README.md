# World-Population-Analysis-EDA
- This repository contains the code and data for a project on Exploratory Analysis of World Population between 1960-2020. The project uses the world-population.csv dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandhuh/countries-in-the-world-by-population-2022

# Data Content

 This dataset contains current estimates (live population clock), historical data, and projected figures of world countries and dependent territories. Data based on the latest United Nations Population Division estimates.

### Attribute Information

- Country/Other - Name of countries and dependent territories.
- Population (2020) - Population in the year 2020
- Yearly Change - Percentage Yearly Change in Population
- Net Change - Net Change in Population
- Density (P/Km²)- Population density (population per square km)
- Land Area (Km²) - Land area of countries / dependent territories.
- Migrants (net) - Total number of migrants
- Fert. Rate - Fertility rate
- Med. Age - Median age of the population
- Urban Pop %- Percentage of urban population
- World Share - Population share

## Conclusion 
* In This Project, I made Exploratory data analysis of world population between 1960-2020.I have explored lots of insights by visualizing the dataset. According to my analysis European,American and far east countries's population growing raito is reducing each year.
